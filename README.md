# Deep Learning Nanodegree
## Neural Network
## Project: Predicting Bike Sharing Data

## Project Overview
This project is a part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program. In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! The model will predict daily bike rental ridership. By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

## Software and Libraries
- Download anaconda or miniconda.
- Create a new conda environment:

  conda create --name dlnd python=3

- Enter your new environment:

  Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd

  Windows: >> activate dlnd

- Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:

  conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook

- Run the following to open up the notebook server:

  jupyter notebook

- In your browser, open my_first_neural_network.ipynb

- Follow the instructions in the notebook; they will lead you through the project. You'll ultimately be editing the my_answers.py python file, whose components are imported into the notebook at various places.
